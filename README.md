# Falling Math
## A math game where your worst enemy is time

### What the Project Does
This is a math game consisting of 12 playable levels (0-11). 
Three correct answers advances the player to the next level.
Each level is either harder than the previous one, or using one or more different operation.
For example, going from calculating the product of two integers to three.

### Why the project is useful
I made this because I wanted to increase the speed of which I can do mental calculations.
And I assume it can be of similar benefit to others.

### How users can get started with the project
[The game is playable here](https://robiniversen.com/falling-math/index.html).

### Where users can get help with the project
The most obvious improvment is adding more levels.
I'm thinking level 11-21 could be a copy of 0-10, but using integers that are two digits long.
Or they might ask for the square root of a integer, and the result of an exponentiation.
